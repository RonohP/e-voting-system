# E-Voting System
The online voting system is a digital platform designed to meet the electoral needs of universities and colleges.

This platform allows the populace to vote regardless of their various locations because of its internet infrastructure.

It eludes the filling of manual forms in the voting process and solves cases of vote miscount.

Multiple votes and impersonations are also eliminated.

The system also allows for interaction of candidates and voters.

Also, with physical restrictions in place to curb the spread of COVID-19, this system provides a way to ensure that the student union is not redundant and elections can be conducted as at when due.

## SDG Goal
The system also serves to achieve SDG 16 which is to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”.
